## Wi-Fi settings

A Wi-Fi configuration sets up access to a wireless network.

A user can modify some of the Wi-Fi settings on the device. However, the MDM server may or may not receive information about the changes, which is based on the device OS. Therefore, the configurations will not be re-pushed automatically to the device to override the configuration on the device with the configuration on the server.

Delegation with custom distribution option is available for this configuration. For more information, see *Distributing the configuration* topic in [**Working with Configurations**](./Working_with_Configurations.md).

Some specific versions of Android devices may require administrators to enter domain and additional information to connect to a TLS, TTLS, PEAP, etc. (WPA2) networks. It is recommended to ensure changes to Wi-Fi configuration are made on selected devices before making these changes on a larger set of devices.

Android 14.x devices registered on any Ivanti Neurons for MDM version earlier than 94 will have the Config status in “Pending Install” state. When you upgrade the Ivanti Neurons for MDM to 94 without editing the Wi-Fi configuration, the configuration status remains in "Pending Install" state. You must enable the Domain field for EAP\_PEAP and update the Domain and Certs in configuration to update the status to “Installed” state.

**Procedure**

1. Go to **Configurations** > **+Add**.
2. Select the  **Wi-Fi** configuration.
3. Enter a **Name** for the configuration.
4. Enter a description.
5. Configure the Wi-Fi settings as per the following descriptions.
6. Click **Next**.
7. (macOS only) In the Distribute page, select one of the following distribution options:\* Device channel - the configuration is effective for all users on a device, which is the typical option.
   - User channel - the configuration is effective only for the currently registered user on a device.
8. Select one of the following distribution options:\* All Devices
   - No Devices (default)
   - Custom.
9. Click **Done**.

The following table lists the Wi-Fi Settings:

| Disable Captive Network Detection (iOS 10+) | Administrators can enable or disable Wi-Fi Captive bypass mode. When Apple detects the presence of a captive portal, it opens a login screen to request access. You can disable the detection of captive portals, requiring the user to manually launch a web browser which triggers the portal login of the captive network. This new setting is useful when an ISE captive portal prevents the login screen from popping up, leading users to believe that their unconnected devices are actually connected to the Internet. |

  \| Disable MAC Address Randomization             | In iOS 14.0+ and macOS 15.0+, Apple changed the default behavior for a device reporting its Wi-Fi MAC address to report a random address for new connections instead of the device's actual Wi-Fi MAC address. As a result, this feature may cause unexpected behavior for enterprises using captive portals or filtering of MAC addresses.Administrators can **Disable MAC Address Randomization** for a Wi-Fi network by editing the associated Wi-Fi configuration and turning on this option (by default, false). This will cause the Wi-Fi configuration to be re-pushed to all devices. This option displays a privacy warning in the device Settings indicating that the network has reduced privacy protections.A device user can still manually turn this on or off through their device's settings. |
