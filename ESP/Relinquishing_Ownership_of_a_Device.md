Applicable to Android devices in Work Profile on Company Owned Device mode.

Relinquishing ownership of a device in Work Profile on Company Owned Device mode removes the work profile and retires the device from Ivanti Neurons for MDM, without affecting personal apps and data. The end user can then use the device as a personal device, with full access to all device controls and settings.

The device needs to be removed from Google Zero Touch or Knox Mobile Enrollment portal.

You might relinquish ownership of a device if:

- the user left the company
- the user has replaced the device

**Procedure**

1. Go to **Devices > Devices**.
2. Select the device.
3. Click **Device details page** and click
