- Do not use this feature if:\* you are changing users or administering situations where users are likely to change

  - shared iPad devices
  - Android Kiosk mode devices

## Ivanti Neurons for MDM license requirements

Device Compliance is a Premium offering and is available to Secure UEM Premium and Platinum customers. For existing customers, a Platinum license suffices.
