Policies define requirements for devices, as well as what will happen if a device does not comply with requirements. Each policy consists of a rule and a compliance action (what happens if the rule is violated). Use the **Policies** page to select, set up, and distribute policies.

This section contains the following topics:

- [**Working with Policies**](./Working_with_Policies.md)
- [**Custom Policy**](./Custom_Policy.md)
- [**Monitoring and Controlling Allowed Apps**](./Monitoring_and_Controlling_Allowed_Apps.md)
- [**Prioritizing Policies**](./Prioritizing_Policies.md)
