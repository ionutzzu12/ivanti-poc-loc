A Lockdown & Kiosk: Android Device Admin mode configuration disables certain features of Android devices and creates a Allowlist of apps that will be available to users in Kiosk mode.

The Android Device Admin Mode Configuration is deprecated and not supported for devices on Android 8 and later versions. It is recommended to use Android Enterprise Lockdowns for Kiosk Lockdowns on Android 8 and later versions.

You can restrict the option to modify settings or apps when an Android device is in Kiosk mode.

- Add apps and select settings in the Create Lockdown & Kiosk: Android Device Admin Mode Configuration page.
- The option to change the settings using the Settings icon will be available in Kiosk mode.
- Select apps without choosing any settings configuration options and the settings icon will not be displayed in Kiosk mode.
- If you choose not to include any apps in the configuration, then  the settings icon will be displayed.

For Samsung devices with Knox Standard 4.0 or higher, the multi-user feature is automatically locked down in kiosk mode.

For non-Samsung devices, Kiosk mode is not supported on Android 8.0 or higher. Ivanti recommends using Android Enterprise lockdowns for Kiosk mode on Android 8.0 or later.
