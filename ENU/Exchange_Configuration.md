An Exchange configuration sets up ActiveSync-based email on Android, iOS, and visionOS devices and  Exchange Web Services (EWS)-based email for macOS devices.

The Exchange Configuration is deprecated by Samsung in Android 9. For Samsung devices on Android 9 and later versions, the Exchange Configuration is not supported in Device Admin mode.
