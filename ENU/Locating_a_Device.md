If you have enabled the Locate feature for a device, you can display the last known location for that device. You must edit the [**privacy configuration**](./Privacy_Configuration.md) to enable collection of Location data and apply the configuration to the device to enable this feature. The device must also support this feature, and users must agree to share their location data.

**Procedure**

1. Navigate to the device in the [**Devices  page**](./Devices.md).
2. Click the link in the **Name** column.
3. In the **Overview** tab, click on the link under **Device Location**.

The following details are displayed on the page:

| **Field name**      | **Description**                                                                                |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Last located on** | Displays the date and time when the device was last located.                                   |
| **Coordinates**     | Displays the latitude (north-south position) and longitude (east-west position) of the device. |

You can also find the device location map displayed in the page.
