Bulk enrollment allows you to register multiple Android devices using the device identifiers. You can upload the CSV file to add devices in bulk.

**Procedure**

1. In the **Devices** page, click **Bulk Enrollment** tab. The **Bulk Enrollment** page is displayed.
2. Click **Add**.
3. In the **Profile Name** text field, enter the name of the Profile. Optionally, click **+Add description** to provide a description for the CSV file.
4. In the **Upload CSV** section, click **Download CSV Template** to download the CSV template. Using the existing format, you can edit the file to add devices.Allows up to 200000 rows at a time in bulk enrollment CSV.
5. After editing and saving the CSV file, click **Upload CSV** to upload the CSV file. A confirmation on the successful upload is displayed.Rows with inadequate information may result in CSV upload failure. Each record should include at least the serial number and manufacturer information, or the IMEI value.To remove the added CSV file, click on the 'minus' icon. To choose a different CSV file to upload click on the **Choose a different file** link.
6. Optional: Select **Assign custom attributes without token** to bulk enroll all types of devices without generating a token. This option is not selected by default.Bulk enrollment without token can also be applied when the IMEI or the combination of Serial number and Manufacturer (with or without custom attributes) is provided in the uploaded CSV file. But the registration of the device depends on the correctness in the attribute values uploaded in the CSV file. The following table explains the scenarios on the outcome based on the attribute value combination entered for bulk enrollment:| **Scenario** | **Entered Attribute values** |                   |                  | Device registration status |
   \| ------------ | ---------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------- |
   \|              | **IMEI**                     | **Serial Number** | **Manufacturer** |                            |
   \| 1            | Correct                      | Incorrect         | Incorrect        | Device is registered       |
