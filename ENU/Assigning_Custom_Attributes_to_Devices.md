You can assign custom device attributes such as internal ID to one or more devices. Each attribute has a corresponding value that you can use for tasks like creating configurations and device groups. After you create custom attributes, you can assign them to devices. For more information about managing attributes, see [**Attributes**](./Attributes.md).
