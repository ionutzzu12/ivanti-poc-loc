## Solution Overview

Continuous access to business data on mobile devices and other endpoints outside the corporate network requires a dedicated focus on security. To keep up with current security needs, enterprises need to consider how they can:

- Provision endpoints such as mobile phones and laptops
- Grant access based on a set of imperative data
- Protect data at rest and in motion
- Enforce measures as required

The Ivanti solution to this modern problem meets all the challenges. You can monitor endpoints and trigger adaptive policies to remediate threats, quarantine devices, and maintain compliance. Together, the following components help your organization realize the mobile-centric zero trust framework: 

- Ivanti Neurons for MDM - Helps you create a secure workspace on any device with apps, configurations, and policies for the user based on their role. Users get easy and secure access to the resources they need for their productivity

## Device Admin (DA) mode to manage Android devices - deprecated

Device Admin (DA) mode of managing Android devices is being deprecated in phased manner from Ivanti Neurons for MDM 78 onwards.

Any new users with a new tenant created on Ivanti Neurons for MDM 78, will not be able to register any devices (Android 6 and later) in DA mode. Any new tenants that need to enable DA registration for Android 6 to Android 9 must contact Ivanti Support.

- Android 10 and later devices will continue to be blocked from registering to DA mode.
- For existing users (with or without existing DA deployments), there are no changes in terms of managing the existing DA devices (Android 6 to Android 11). However, on upgrading to Ivanti Neurons for MDM 78, any newly registered devices running Android 10+ on existing tenants will also not be allowed to run in DA mode. Such existing tenants would only be able to enroll devices from Android 6 to Android 9 versions in DA mode.
- If any users are planning to migrate DA devices from a Core instance to the Ivanti Neurons for MDM R78, ensure that Android Enterprise is enabled and at least one system configuration is distributed to the target set: PO, DO, or COPE before triggering the migration. This step is essential to prevent the retirement of devices post migration.

| DA registration type                        | Existing tenant (upgraded to 78) | New tenant  |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------- |
| New DA registration of device with OS >=10  | Not Allowed                      | Not allowed |
| New DA registration of device with OS \< 10 | Allowed                          | Not allowed |
| Existing DA devices with OS >= 10           | Will remain active               | NA          |
| Existing DA devices with OS \< 10           | Will remain active               | NA          |
| Migrated DA devices with OS >= 10           | Will Retire                      | Will Retire |
| Migrated DA devices with OS \< 10           | Will remain active               | Will Retire |
