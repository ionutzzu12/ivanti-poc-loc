As part of the End of Support for Content announced April 15, 2017, the ability to add new Content has been disabled. Content currently uploaded can still be distributed to the Apple iBooks app and used.

**Procedure**

1. Click **Add** (bottom left)
2. Type the category name. Categories are not case sensitive.
3. Click **Save**.
