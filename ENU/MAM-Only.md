Ivanti Neurons for MDM allows you to specify iOS and Android devices as MAM-only and provides Mobile App Management (MAM) to such devices. A MAM-only deployment allows you to distribute and manage apps without having to manage the device itself.

## MAM-Only Solution - Ivanti AppStation Alternative

As an alternate solution to Ivanti AppStation, Ivanti is offering a modern and flexible Mobile Application Management (MAM) solution using the Ivanti Go Client, available for both iOS and Android platforms.

The new MAM-Only solution introduces an integrated App Catalog along with Ivanti Neurons for MDM Web Clip functionality, which together fulfills the core use cases previously addressed by App Station in delivering a simplified, secure, and unified App Management experience for both users and administrators.

### Key features

- **In-App App Catalog**: Hosts and distributes approved, managed apps directly within the Go Client.
- **App Configuration and Updates**: Supports application-level configuration and version updates, enforced through MAM policies.
- Ivanti Neurons for MD&#x4D;**&#x20;Requirement**: Ideal for BYOD and contractor scenarios where Ivanti Neurons for MDM enrollment is not feasible.

### Using Web Clip for Ease of Access

- **Direct Access to App Catalog**: Deployment of Web Clips via Ivanti Neurons for MDM to provide a shortcut to the App Catalog or specific web-based enterprise apps.
- **Custom App shortcuts**: Allows users to quickly launch frequently used resources from their home screen.

### Enhanced Admin and User Experience

- **Unified Interface**: Combines App Catalog, Web Access, and Compliance Messaging into one experience.
- **Simplified Administration**: No need to maintain separate solutions (i.e., App Station), reducing complexity and risk of configuration drift.

### Flexibility and Customization

- **Customize Catalog Views**: Customizing the App Catalog contents based on user roles, geo-location, or organizational unit.
- **Uses Existing Infrastructure**: Leverages your existing Ivanti Neurons for MDM / MAM investment (no separate infrastructure is required).

### Support for dual role users

The Ivanti MAM-Only solution is designed to support modern work scenarios, including users with dual roles:

- **Full time employee - Org A**: Access enterprise apps via a Webclip (e.g., Apps\@Work) deployed through Ivanti Neurons for MDM.
- **Contractor - Org B**: Use Ivanti Go Client in MAM-Only mode to securely access managed applications—without requiring device enrollment in Ivanti Neurons for MDM.

This enables seamless, role-based access to necessary apps without profile conflicts or device management overlap.
