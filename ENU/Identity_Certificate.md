This section contains the following topics:

- [**Identity certificate settings**](./Identity_Certificate.md)
- [**Distributing the configuration**](./Identity_Certificate.md)

An identity certificate configuration defines a certificate authentication mechanism for mobile devices. Identity certificates are X.509 certificates (.p12 or .pfx). Also, the identity certificates can be generated dynamically using the [**Certificate Authority**](./Certificate_Management.md) as a source. Before beginning, you should already know how you plan to distribute certificates to your mobile devices. You should also have configured any necessary certificate authority.

Starting from release 91, the Device Identity certificate for Apple devices is automatically renewed within 30 days of expiry. iOS devices receive renewed MDM certificates from Ivanti Neurons for MDM as part of the regular device check-in flow. However, iOS devices need to be re-enrolled with Ivanti Neurons for MDM when they are offline long enough for the MDM certificate to expire before a check-in that would have renewed the certificate before expiration.

- SHA-1 certificates are deprecated while creating the identity certificates. You can choose other algorithms. While updating the certificates, if the older certificates use SHA-1, the same SHA-1 algorithm can be used. If the older certificates use an algorithm above SHA-1, then switching to SHA-1 is not allowed.
- After configuring an identity certificate, you can click **Test Configuration and continue** to issue and verify the validity of the test certificate. An error may display by performing this test for a new or an existing dynamically generated identity certificate configuration if the subject name is the same as the local certificate authority. When this error message is displayed you should modify the identity certificate subject name which should be different from the local certificate authority subject name. For existing identity certificate configurations that are modified with the subject name, the certificates are re-issued and the configurations are re-pushed.If you have setup the option to create a configuration without issuing test certificate for **Dynamically Generated** certificate distribution, click **Continue**.
- Certificates will be re-issued implicitly.
- When Identity certificates are assigned to Android apps, the user's app get Identity certificates without prompting the users to grant the permission (rather than app) to use the certificate. It includes all apps like Email+, Gmail, etc.
- Email+ can be configured with a user provided identity certificate and pushed and assigned as an app configuration to Android enterprise devices. It is applicable only to Work Profile on Company Owned Device and Device Owner modes.

## Identity certificate settings

| Name                     | Enter a name that identifies this configuration.                                                                                      |
| Description              | Enter a description that clarifies the purpose of this configuration.                                                                 |
| Certificate Distribution | Select the type of certificate distribution to set up:\* **Single File**: Upload an existing certificate for distribution to devices. |

- **Dynamically Generated**: Create certificates on request using a local or external certificate authority.
- **User provided**: Create labels for the type of certificates to be uploaded by the user. When created, the user will be able to see the created labels (options) in  the self-service portal, and upload certificates corresponding to these labels.
- **Derived Credential :** Specify one of the following usages for the derived credential:\* Authentication
  - Encryption
  - Signing
  - Decryption

***

- **SCEP Config**: Specify how to request a certificate from a SCEP server. Select one of the following configurations:\* Apple Config
  - Windows ConfigYour selection determines which options display in the rest of the form. |
    \| Allow All Apps to access Private Key (macOS 10.10+)          | **Applicable to:** Single file, Dynamically Generated, User Provided, and SCEP Apple Config identity certificates.(Optional) For PKCS#12 certificates, enable the **Allow All Apps to access Private Key** option to allow all apps access to the private key.For example, this key can be used in cases where a password is requested from the user to allow access to a certificate used for VPN.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Just drag and drop the certificate to the designated area or click **Create from Certificate** to select the certificate from your file system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
