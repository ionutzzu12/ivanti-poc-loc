Sentry is a component that acts as a gateway between mobile devices and your ActiveSync-enabled email system. Use Sentry to control which devices are allowed to access email. It is available to download as an ISO file that you can install on a virtual machine. Organizations should consider using a load balancer to maintain multiple (redundant) Sentrys.
