Create a temporary support administrator to enable the service support team to log in with your [**roles**](./User_Roles.md) and permissions. This user expires automatically in 7 days, or you can end access at any time. Creating a support administrator makes it easier for the support team to troubleshoot issues.

## Creating a support administrator

Procedure

1. In the **Support Administrators** page, click **Add Support User**.
2. Click **Create User** to confirm.

This step sends an email to the device management service support team.

The **Display Name** field shows "(disabled)" until a support team member activates the new account. The resulting display name will have the following format:

support-\[random\_ID]-\[your\_username]@\[your\_company].com

Once you create a support administrator, selecting **Admin > Support Administrators** takes you directly to the list of existing support administrators. Therefore, if you need to create additional support users, go directly to step 2 above.

## Viewing user history

In the **Support Administrators** page, click **User History** to view the login history of the support administrators. The availability of the login history data in the Support Administrators page is restricted to the last 90 days of data.

## Ending access for a support administrator

Procedure

1. In the **Support Administrators** page, click the **Delete** link to the right of the account you want to remove.
2. When prompted, click **Remove User** to confirm.

## Suspending access for a support administrator

In the **Support Administrators** page, click the **Disable** link to the right of the account you want to suspend.
