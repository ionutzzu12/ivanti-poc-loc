## Setting up BitLocker Encryption

BitLocker Encryption is a feature that enforces encryption on hard drives and removable drives of the devices for data protection. It is a prerequisite to have a Bridge setup to manage BitLocker encryption. See [**Bridge**](./Ivanti_Bridge.md) for more details. BitLocker Encryption Configuration helps you in configuring encryption settings to device(s).

**Procedure**

1. In the **Configuration** tab, click **+Add**.
2. Select **BitLocker Encryption** configuration. The **BitLocker Encryption** page is displayed.
3. In the **Name** field, type an appropriate name for the BitLocker encryption.
4. Click the **+Add Description** link to add a description for the configuration. This field is optional.
5. In the Configuration Setup section, configure the following settings:| Setting                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

## Viewing BitLocker Settings

You can view the BitLocker Settings that is set for a device in the Device details page (**Devices>Devices>\[Device name]**) under the **BitLocker Settings** section. By default, the details are hidden.

You can view the following details by clicking on the view (eye shaped) icon next to each field:

| Setting               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| **Recovery Password** | When this option is selected, the recovery password is generated by Windows and returned to Ivanti Neurons for MDM after pushing the BitLocker configuration. If the device goes through recovery mode, the user is prompted to type this password.The same recovery password should be used if multiple drives are encrypted.Recover password will only be posted if recovery option **Use password and store in AD and MobileIron** is selected. |
| **PIN**               | Displays the startup 6-digit PIN. The PIN is displayed only if you have selected the option **Require Startup PIN with TPM** in the BitLocker configuration setup.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Startup Password**  | The startup password set for the device. The startup password is displayed only if you have selected the option **Do not useTPM** in the BitLocker configuration settings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **TPM version**       | Displays the configured TPM version.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Some fields might display **N/A** based on the settings configured in the BitLocker configuration setup.

- The status of encryption is displayed under Device encryption status in the Device Details page.
- The same Startup password or PIN will be used for all the drives of a device for which the BitLocker would be applied.
- If you are creating a configuration to encrypt a second drive of a device which already has a drive encrypted and recovery password saved, the earlier password will be overwritten. Hence, it is recommended that the Recovery Password option is used only for one drive in a device.
