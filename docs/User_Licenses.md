Ivanti Neurons for MDM user-based licenses define the number of users you can register, the number of devices allowed per user license, the amount of content you can configure for distribution to devices, and which features are available. If you reach your limit for users, a red triangle displays on the Admin page. If you reach your limit for content, the service will prevent you from adding more and display a message to indicate that you have reached your limit.

To determine how many user licenses you should plan for consider the following points:

- Each user license purchased under the Secure UEM or Secure UEM Premium package allows registration of up to five devices.
- Once a user registers more than five devices, another user license is claimed.
- There is no enforced limit to the number of user licenses that a user can claim.
- Licenses are released when devices are retired or wiped.

For example, when User1 registers her work phone on the first day of work, she claims a user license. The following week, she registers two personal phones and a tablet under that same license. When she registers another tablet, she now has five devices, so she claims a second user license. When her personal phone is stolen, she wipes the device, which releases the second user license.
