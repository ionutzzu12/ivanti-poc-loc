iOS restrictions are settings that help the primary user of the device control what other users are allowed to do with iOS, watchOS, and visionOS devices. These settings are defined by Apple and managed by Ivanti Neurons for MDM.

During the distribution of this configuration to [**Shared iPads**](./Shared_iPad_devices_for_business.md), you can select either the Device Channel or the User Channel . This is useful to distribute separate configurations and enforce restrictions that are applicable only to the device or the user channel.

The global administrators can delegate space administrators to edit the configuration for **All Devices and for the Custom distribution** option. For the iOS Restriction configure, you can optionally select the **Allow this configuration to be available in all Spaces** option.

The distribution changes are applicable only to the specific space. All other spaces continue to inherit the default space distribution settings.
