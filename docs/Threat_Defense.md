**Applicable to:**

- Go for iOS client version 3.2.0 or supported newer versions.
- Go for Android client version 52 or supported newer versions.

Ivanti Neurons for MDM includes the ability to distribute activation tokens to enable Threat Defense technology integrated into Go for Android and iOS clients. Threat Defense protects managed devices from mobile threats and vulnerabilities affecting device, network, and applications.

When this configuration is enabled in Ivanti Neurons for MDM and applied to the devices, the Threat Defense libraries are enabled on the Go clients. The Threat Defense service can be deactivated by removing the license token and resending the license configuration to the client.

Threat Defense monitors:

- On the device level: system parameters, configuration, firmware, and libraries to identify suspicious or malicious activity.
- On the network level: network traffic and suspicious connections to and from mobile devices.
- On the app level: leaky apps (potentially placing enterprise data at risk) and malicious apps, through risk assessment and code analysis.
