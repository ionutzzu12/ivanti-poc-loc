When a device is configured with this option, the user login screen will be displayed, allowing an end user to log in to the shared device kiosk.Enable Login option will be visible if and only if user is created as Android Enterprise Device Account user (staging user).SelectUse domain substitutionand enter the domain appropriately.This option checks the username for domain suffix. If the domain suffix is missing, the system automatically appends the domain suffix to the username.
- **Enable Logout**: When a device is configured with this option, the logged in end user will have access to the Allowlisted apps. This user can see the option to log out, but cannot exit kiosk. When a user logs out of the shared device kiosk, another user can login to the shared device kiosk and view the apps as configured by the admin.
- Apps appear with a Recycle icon, which is used for enforcing reinstallation of an app on every login. This option can be used for those apps that are locally cache data.User can exit kiosk mode if admin provides the exit kiosk PIN.
- **Timeout**: Specify the timeout duration in hours. For example, when the timeout duration is configured for 2 hours and the end user fails to logout of the shared device kiosk, the logout action will be automatically performed on the device after 2 hours.The **Timeout** field is displayed only when the **Enable Logout** option is selected and it is optional.You can also logout end users from shared kiosk mode by clicking the **Sign out Android enterprise kiosk** option in the device details page. |

The PIN must have a minimum of 6 digits and a maximum of 10 digits. This PIN applies to all the devices in kiosk mode.Previously, the Kiosk PIN length was 4 digits. The user can continue to use the 4-digit PIN even after upgrading from a previous version to Ivanti Neurons for MDM 82. However, if there are any configuration changes, the PIN length must be set as per the new requirement (i.e., min 6 digits and max 10 digits).The Go app will protect the device against brute force attacks.
