Ivanti Neurons for MDM enables Network Relay configuration for the payload you use for configuring relay settings for a device or an application without the need for VPN or tunnels to access private resources.

**Applicable to**

- iOS 17.0 through the most recently released version as supported by Ivanti Neurons for MDM.
- macOS 14 through the most recently released version as supported by by Ivanti Neurons for MDM.
- visionOS 1.1 through the most recently released version as supported by by Ivanti Neurons for MDM.

**Procedure**

1. Go to **Configurations** > **+Add**.
2. Search and select the **Network Relay** configuration.
3. Configure the **Network Relay** settings as per the following table:| **Setting**                                                        | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

   \| **Match FQDNs**(supported on iOS 18.4+ and macOS 15.4+ devices)    | Specify the list of Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs), also known as hostnames, which should be routed through the servers contained in Relays. Any connection that matches this exact FQDN or hostname will use the relays. If no FQDNs and no 'MatchDomains' are listed, traffic to all domains, except those matching an excluded domain or excluded FQDN, will be routed to the relay servers.              |
   \| **Exclude FQDNs** (supported on iOS 18.4+ and macOS 15.4+ devices) | Specify the list of Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs), also known as hostnames, which should **NOT** be routed through the servers contained in Relays. Any connection that matches the FQDN exactly will not use the relay server. When 'MatchDomains' are also specified, any FQDN listed here in 'ExcludedFQDNs' should be a sub-domain of at least one MatchDomain. Otherwise, it will not have any effect. |
