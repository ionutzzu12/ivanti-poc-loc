Ivanti Neurons for MDM enables Extensible Single Sign-On (SSO) with the Extensible SSO and Extensible SSO Kerberos configurations. The implementation requires an app extension, such as Microsoft Authenticator, from the identity provider. With an Extensible SSO implementation, users need to only authenticate once when accessing enterprise resources. Users are not prompted to authenticate for subsequent logins. For information about setup information for the intended identity provider, see [**Configure Identity Provider**](./Configure_Identity_Provider.md).

This section contains the following topics:

- [**Single sign-on account settings**](./Single_Sign-On_Configuration.md)
- [**Extensible single sign-on account settings**](./Single_Sign-On_Configuration.md)
- [**Extensible single sign-on Kerberos account settings**](./Single_Sign-On_Configuration.md)

## Single sign-on account settings

**Applicable to:**

- iOS 7.0 through the most recently released version as supported by Ivanti Neurons for MDM.
- visionOS 1.1 through the most recently released version as supported by by Ivanti Neurons for MDM.

Use the following settings to configure Kerberos-based enterprise SSO for any managed app and Apple Safari browser on iOS devices.

This configuration requires Tunnel and Sentry. For more information, see "Setting up single sign-on with Kerberos" in the *Tunnel for iOS Guide*.

## Extensible single sign-on account settings

**Applicable to:**

- iOS 13.0 through the most recently released version as supported by Ivanti Neurons for MDM.
- macOS 10.15 through the most recently released version as supported by Ivanti Neurons for MDM.
- visionOS 1.1 through the most recently released version as supported by by Ivanti Neurons for MDM.

Use the following settings to configure the SSO extension profile with the generic extension type to enable SSO for native apps and websites with various authentication methods.

Extensible SSO does not work when the configuration is pushed in the user channel for macOS 10.15.x devices.

- Enter the **Realm** name. This value should be properly capitalized.
- **Redirect**\* Enter one or more **URL** prefixes of identity providers where the app extension performs SSO. The URLs must begin with http\:// or https\://, the scheme and host name are matched case-insensitively, query parameters and URL fragments are not allowed, and the URLs of all installed Extensible SSO payloads must be unique. |

| Credential Use Mode                     | This setting affects how the Kerberos Extension credential is used by other processes. Use one of the following:\* Always (default) - The extension credential will always be used if the service principal name (SPN) matches the Kerberos Extension Hosts array. The credential will not be used if the calling app is not in credentialBundleIDACL. |

- When Not Specified - The credential will only be used when another credential has not been specified by the caller and the SPN matches the Kerberos Extensions Hosts array. The credential will not be used if the calling app is not in credentialBundleIDACL.
- Kerberos Default - The default Kerberos processes for selecting credentials is used which normally uses the default Kerberos credential. This is the same as turning off this capability.(Optional) Select **Require TLS for LDAP**. |
